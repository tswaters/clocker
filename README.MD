# Clocker

Reimplementation of the 'ol CLOCK.EXE... with docking, too!
Some games go into full screen mode and it's quite hard to see what time it is.
Especially if you're like me and only have the task bar on the primary window.
Dock this bad-boy on one of your spare monitors (you have many monitors, yes?)
and never be blindsighted by 3am again!

todo:

- [x] options (colours, etc.)
- [x] remember startup position / docking (does windows do this?)
- [x] verify it works in full screen mode (this is why I wrote it)
- [x] create a setup project that can set as startup (I'm lazy)
- [x] unit tests!
